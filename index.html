            I have grown up fascinated with the arts. I loved dancing, drawing, coloring, singing,
        playing dress-up, anything that allowed me to be someone else. I would force my cousins, who
        were 10 years older than me, to always be part of dance routines I created. I know listening to a 6
        year old boss you around was the highlight of their day. Since then, my passion for the arts has
        grown and changed. Drawing stick figures turned into picture-perfect portrait drawings. Writing
        my name in the fanciest ways I could imagine evolved into a love for typography.
        <br><br>

            The closest people throughout my life have always been my family, friends, and art
        teachers. They saw the potential in me that I had yet to discover until now. I have them to thank
        for motivating me to be the designer I am today. Art has always given me the freedom to express
        myself. I want my art to reflect my love for the craft. I want my art to reflect my love for
        expression. I want my art to reflect my passion.
        <br><br>

            I believe art is about making a statement. I want to invoke emotion. I want to make people
        angry. I want them to feel something when they lay eyes on my work. I hope to inspire just as
        much as I hope to anger.
