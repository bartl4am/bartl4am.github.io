                            The CMU Department of Art and Design asked my Design Bureau class to create a mural for the building that captured the essence of Wightman. I took a different approach. My idea was to use art to send a bigger message. The deaf community is greatly marginalzied in society even though it spans all races, genders, sexualities, identities, and cultures. I wanted to bring inclusivity into Wightman. Using American Sign Language, I created two murals that would allow the students of Wightman to learn ASL and become more inclusive in a fun way.

                    <div class="project-container">
                        <img src="MURAL ASSETS/Wightman Mural1.jpg">
        
                        
        
                        <p> 
                            Aside from just showcasing the very talented students, I wanted to bring awareness to the deaf community. The locker mural shown above says "ART" in ASL and would be spraypainted directly onto the lockers.

                    </div>

                    
                    
                    <div class="project-container">
                        <video autoplay muted>
                            <source src="MURAL ASSETS/mural2.MP4" type="video/mp4">
                            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
                        </video>

        
                        <p>
                            The multi-color mural shown above says "Art Saves." It also includes the alphabet along the bottom as a key for students to learn how to fingerspell. I chose "Art Saves" because art is something that allows us to express our emotions without actually saying them. It can save our life as an outlet to expression, which is something that I adore about it and always have.
