                            Aside from being a student and a print-lab assistant, I am also the Central Michigan University Art Gallery's in-house Graphic Designer. I design the posters, postcards, and social media posts for the exhibitions that come through the gallery.

                            Shown here is the catalogue I created for <em>SEARING:</em> Works by the Women's Environmental Photography Collective. This exhibition highlighted the climate crisis and showcases various effects of said crisis. One of my favorite exhibitions in the gallery thus far.

                            The CMU Department of Art and Design had asked me to extend my gallery duties to them in creating a sandwich board poster for the 2024 Homecoming. One of my favorite posters I created, this was seen from the sidewalks in front of Wightman welcoming in students and families to the fesitivies. </p>

                            <em>Between Two Worlds</em> was the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art's capstone exhibition. There were two students in the class, so they gave me pretty free reign of what kind of design to create. I incorporated zoomed in photographs of one of the students work in the title. This is rare as one of my limitations for the gallery is not being able to manipulate the images given to me.

                        <p>
                            This poster was done for the Annual Juried CMU Student Art Exhibition. I also created the prospectus and annoucnment poster for the competition. I wanted it to have a "found letter" feel and incorporated that design into all aspects of the design.

                            Lastly, this was one of the first flyers that I had created for the gallery. Katie Mongoven was the Barstow Artist-in-Reference in the fall of 2024. Her artwork was mostly fiber-spun works with beads. I wanted the flowiness of fabric to shine in the design, so I utilized a loose font for the title and extended those elements to the decorations in the background.
